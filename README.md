# R0-projections-in-C
Since people have been comparing SARS-Cov-2 with Seasonal Flu I worked up a program to show the difference.
With the seasonal Flu we don't think about how we may
be responsible for giving it to 16 or more people in a few weeks
but think about giving SARS-Cov-2 to 100 to 10,000 or more people in the next 2 months.  
We started with under 50 cases
in November or December of 2019 and here at the end of March
we have at least 700,000 cases!  This is why we ALL need to be
careful not to spread this virus whether we have symptoms or not.
